PROBLEM STATEMENT:
        Diabetes is linked to an increased likelihood for a number of serious, sometimes life-threatening complications. 
Proper diabetes management can reduce the risk of complications and improve quality of life. 
However, little is known about which aspects of disease management and patient care factors or what combination of the factors may predict an acute situation that leads to unnecessary hospitalizations.

DATA MODELLING:
        We have our final dataset.We train the model in a way that it can predict (almost) correct results.
        In this dataset, we filled missing values using mean, median mode methods.
        We have split the data into train and test.
        We will train the model on training data and predict the results on the test data. 
BEST ALGORITHM
        Before jumping into the code, let's get a little background about the SVM RBF kernel.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for either classification or regression challenges.
In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.
Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well.
