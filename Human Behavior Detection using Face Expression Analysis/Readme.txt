PROBLEM STATEMENT 
        Emotions can be both a gift and a curse. 
        They are what makes us human, and we all experience them – whether it is through the ability to feel love and happiness, or pain and suffering. 
        In addition, they are difficult to hide. 
        All emotions, whether they are suppressed or not, are likely to have a physical effect. 
        However, studying emotions can be hard,
        since it is not often clear how to exactly interpret them
EXPECTED RESULTS
        Develop a system to recognize emotional expressions from images of human faces, 
with a high degree of accuracy in many cases.
CNN:
        Convolutional neural network (ConvNets or CNNs) is one of the main categories to do images recognition, images classifications.           Objects detections, recognition faces etc.
        CNN image classifications takes an input image, process it and classify it under certain categories (Eg., Dog, Cat, Tiger, Lion)
USE CASES:
        Our facial emotion detection algorithm can identify seven different type of emotional states in real-time.
